# Building

TextMate builds with **Xcode**. The Xcode project is self-contained — it compiles the checked-in generated sources directly and links the dependencies below.

## Setup

Build the static third-party dependencies into the checkout:

```sh
bin/build_universal_dependencies
```

This downloads Boost, Cap’n Proto, and google-sparsehash, builds those plus
Onigmo for `arm64` and `x86_64`, and writes universal libraries plus headers to
`vendor/prebuilt`. The Xcode project links against that repo-local prefix, so
Homebrew libraries are not used for normal app builds.

Set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`, `BOOST_VERSION`, `CAPNP_VERSION`, or
`SPARSEHASH_VERSION` in the environment to override the script defaults.

`ragel` and `multimarkdown` are only needed if you regenerate the checked-in generated sources (see below); they are not required for a normal build.

Make sure you have a full checkout including submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/textmate/textmate.git
cd textmate
```

### Build the Onigmo dependency

The regular-expression library (Onigmo) is vendored and built with its own autotools setup, producing the static `libonig.a` that the app links against. Build it once after checkout:

```sh
cd vendor/Onigmo/vendor
./configure && make
cd -
```

## Building the app

Open `Applications/TextMate/TextMate.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build/run the `TextMate` scheme (⌘R), or from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Applications/TextMate/TextMate.xcodeproj -scheme TextMate -configuration Debug build
```

## Regenerating generated sources (optional)

Some sources are generated and committed to the repository, so a normal build does not run any code generators. Regenerate them only when you edit the corresponding schema/source:

 * **Cap’n Proto** — `*.capnp` → `*.capnp.c++` / `*.capnp.h` (requires `capnp`)
 * **Ragel** — `Frameworks/plist/src/ascii.rl` → `ascii.cc` (requires `ragel`)

# Python Diagnostics

This fork ships a *Python Diagnostics* bundle (in `Bundles/`, copied into the app at build time). Whenever a Python file is saved, it runs [Ruff][] and [Pyright][] and shows the results directly in the editor: a gutter icon, a tinted line, a squiggly underline under the offending range, and an Xcode-style message banner at the right edge. Clicking the banner’s icon opens a popover with all issues on that line — with one-click **Apply** buttons for Ruff’s auto-fixes.

## Getting started

1. Install the checkers (either one alone also works):

   ```sh
   brew install ruff pyright
   ```

2. Save a Python file. That’s it — diagnostics appear a moment later (Ruff instantly, Pyright after a few seconds). If something is missing, a notification tells you what to install.

If neither checker is installed, or the `mate` command-line tool cannot be found, the bundle posts a macOS notification (at most once per hour) explaining what to do. Detailed logging for troubleshooting: `tail -f /tmp/tm-python-diagnostics.log`.

## Disabling

Add to any `.tm_properties` file (global `~/.tm_properties`, per project, or per directory — TextMate’s usual scoping applies):

```
TM_PYTHON_DIAGNOSTICS = disabled
```

You can also disable the whole bundle under *Preferences → Bundles → Python Diagnostics*, or scope the variable to specific paths:

```
[ vendor/** ]
TM_PYTHON_DIAGNOSTICS = disabled
```

## Configuration

Both tools use their native configuration files:

 * **Ruff** looks for `ruff.toml` / `.ruff.toml` / `pyproject.toml` next to (or above) the checked file; without one it falls back to the user-level `~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml`.
 * **Pyright** — the bundle searches upward from the file for a `pyrightconfig.json`; without one it uses `~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/pyrightconfig.json` (e.g. for `extraPaths` to custom module stubs). Override the fallback with the `TM_PYRIGHT_PROJECT` variable.

Extra command-line flags can be passed via the `TM_RUFF_ARGS` and `TM_PYRIGHT_ARGS` variables; `TM_RUFF` / `TM_PYRIGHT` override the tool binaries themselves.
